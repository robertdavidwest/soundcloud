FIXME: description

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

Collect and aggregate user data from Soundcloud into a database using Clojure and PostgreSQL.

Soundcloud seem to have an open API. If you look at the requests on a soundcloud page you will see requests being made with a client_id. Use this client ID on your config here.

1. Create a PostgreSQL database called `soundcloud_stats`
2. In `soundcloud_stats` run the SQL script `database/schema_migrations/12.27.2020.11.55_users_and_tracks_up.sql` to create the database tables.
3. Create a `config.edn` file and store it in `src/soundcloud/config.edn` with the following format
    
    ```
    config.edn 
    # ----------------
    {
        :client-id "ABCDEF"
        :users [{
                  :username "some-user"
                  :user-id "1234"
                 } {
                  :username "another-user"
                  :user-id "5678"}
                ...]
	}
    ```
4. Run `-main` and all user and user tracks information will be scraped and stored in the database.
